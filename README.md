# portfolio

This repository contains a small, static personal portfolio website built for the DevOne Hackathon 2025.

The site is intentionally lightweight (plain HTML/CSS/JS) so it can be hosted easily on GitHub Pages, Vercel, or Netlify without a build step.

## What's included

- `index.html` — Single-page site with Home, Projects, Skills, Contact sections
- `css/style.css` — Styles, responsive layout, and small animations
- `js/main.js` — Minimal interactivity (nav toggle, smooth scroll, copy email)
- `screenshots/` — Placeholder folder for screenshots to include in your Devpost

## Tech stack

- Plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no build tools required)

## Local preview

Open `index.html` in your browser. On macOS you can run:

```bash
open index.html
```

The site is static — no server required.

## Deploying (recommended)

- GitHub Pages: push the repository to GitHub and enable Pages on the `main` branch (root). The site will be served at `https://<username>.github.io/<repo>`.
- Vercel / Netlify: connect the repository and deploy — both services support static sites with zero config.

## DevOne Hackathon submission checklist

To qualify for judging, include the following in your Devpost entry:

- Live URL of your hosted portfolio (Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages, etc.)
- Source code repository (public GitHub recommended)
- Devpost project description including:
	- Tech stack used (see above)
	- Features implemented (Home, Projects, Skills, Contact, animations)
	- Custom elements or animations used
	- Screenshots or short video walkthrough (optional but encouraged)
- Optional: Demo video (max 3 minutes)

## Notes and next steps

- Replace placeholder text (Your Name, `your.email@example.com`, and project links) with your real content.
- To add a production contact form, integrate a serverless function or a form provider (Netlify Forms, Formspree, etc.).

Good luck at DevOne Hack 2025 — build something that shows who you are!
