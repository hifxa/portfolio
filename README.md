# portfolio

This repository contains a small, static personal portfolio website.

The site is intentionally lightweight (plain HTML/CSS/JS) so it can be hosted easily on GitHub Pages, Vercel, or Netlify without a build step.

## What's included

- `index.html` — Single-page site with Home, Projects, Skills, Contact sections
- `css/style.css` — Styles, responsive layout, and small animations
- `js/main.js` — Minimal interactivity (nav toggle, smooth scroll, copy email)
- `screenshots/` — Placeholder folder for screenshots to include in your Devpost

## Tech stack

- Plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no build tools required)

## Local preview

Open `index.html` in your browser. On macOS you can run:

```bash
open index.html
```

The site is static — no server required.

## Deploying (recommended)

- GitHub Pages: push the repository to GitHub and enable Pages on the `main` branch (root). The site will be served at `https://<username>.github.io/<repo>`.
- Vercel / Netlify: connect the repository and deploy — both services support static sites with zero config.
